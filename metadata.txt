description=This plugin creates vector layers that work with magnetic variation.
version=0.3
author=Joe Berkovitz
email=joseph.berkovitz@gmail.com
about=Commands in this plugin are available under Plugins > Compass Routes:
    "Create Compass Route Layer": adds a new LineString layer with memory storage rendering as arrows that are automatically labeled with distance and magnetic bearing. The variation for each label is dynamically determined.
    "Create Magnetic North Lines": processing script that adds a vector layer containing magnetic north lines within a given extent. Lines are spaced by a given distance, and are broken and re-spaced to preserve this distance within an error tolerance.
    For full documentation please see the project homepage.

       add custom expression functions for mag. variation
       compute variation dynamically based on geomag model for each line--no more fixed variation
       use tooltips to supplement info in line labels
       add custom-label attribute
       add virtual fields to simplify definition of labels
